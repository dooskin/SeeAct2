# GOAL
Navigate hijabkart.in and add one plausible product to cart. Do not pay. Return price/variant/subtotal.

# ACTIONS  (only these verbs)
OPEN(url) | CLICK(text|selector) | TYPE(selector, text) | ENTER | SCROLL(dir|amount) | FILTER(name=value) | ADD_TO_CART | VIEW_CART
Each step <= 1 action. Prefer exact on-screen labels.

# POLICY
- hot intent: jump to search or “Buy Now” paths; minimize dithering.
- warm intent: compare 2–3 items; skim specs; choose one.
- cold intent: skim a collection; may bounce quickly after one PDP.
- returning: reuse obvious nav routes; accept cookies quickly.
- mobile: keep steps minimal; avoid opening many tabs.
- prefer site-native CTAs and filter labels verbatim.

# STOP
Stop when item is in cart OR you’re stuck after 2 failed attempts. Never proceed to payment.

# OUTPUT  (strict JSON)
