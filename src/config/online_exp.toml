## SeeAct Platform configuration (Online experiment)
## Aligned with README scope: agent, sandbox/patcher, calibration, runner, AVI, reporting.

[basic]
is_demo = false # Online/auto mode (reads tasks from JSON). True = interactive demo.
save_file_dir = "../online_results" # Output directory for logs/artifacts; keep git-ignored and out of version control.
default_task ="Find pdf of paper \"GPT-4V(ision) is a Generalist Web Agent, if Grounded\" from arXiv" # Example default.
default_website = "https://www.google.com/" # Example default start URL.

[experiment]
task_file_path = "../data/online_tasks/task_50_merged.json" # JSON task list for online experiments (ignored when is_demo=true).
overwrite = false # Overwrite existing outputs in save_file_dir; false skips completed tasks.
top_k = 50  # Candidate pruning for element selection if a ranker is enabled.
fixed_choice_batch_size = 17 # Max options per multiple-choice prompt.
# Keep small to avoid huge screenshots that may crash Playwright.
dynamic_choice_batch_size=-1 # <=0 disables dynamic batching by page height; uses fixed batch size.
max_continuous_no_op = 2 # Stop after this many consecutive ineffective operations.
max_op = 30 # Global cap on operations per task (higher for online experiments).
highlight = false # Draw boxes for variant diffs in screenshots (useful for reporting).
monitor = true # Human-in-the-loop confirmation each step; keep true during development for safety.
dev_mode=false # Extra logging/diagnostics.
# storage_state="" # Optional cookies/session file path (avoid automating logins in development).
 ranker_path = "../model/deberta-v3-base" # Optional element ranker; comment out to consider all candidates.

[openai]
# Provider configuration for the SeeAct agent (set keys via env; see README Quick Start).
rate_limit = -1 # Per-process throttle; set >0 to avoid provider rate-limits.
model = "gpt-4o" # Default model; 'gpt-4-vision-preview' is deprecated.
temperature = 0 # Lower = more deterministic, matching “one rationale → one tool call per step”.

[oss_model]
# Placeholder for configuring open-source providers/models if desired.

[playwright]
save_video = true # Save session videos; useful for online experiment auditing (heavier IO).
tracing = true # Save Playwright traces; enables deep debugging but increases runtime and storage.

trace.sources = true # Include source files in traces for deeper inspection.

[runtime]
provider = "local" # "local" | "cdp" | "browserbase"
# For CDP/Browserbase, provide a CDP/WebSocket endpoint and optional headers.
