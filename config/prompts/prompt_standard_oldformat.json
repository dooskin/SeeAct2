Clearly outline which element in the webpage users will operate with as the first next target element, its detailed location, and the corresponding operation.\n\nTo be successful, it is important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue a valid action given the current observation.\n2. You should only issue one action at a time\n3. For handling the select dropdown elements on the webpage, it's not necessary for you to provide completely accurate options right now. The full list of options for these elements will be supplied later.\n4. Unlike humans, for typing (e.g., in text areas, text boxes) and selecting (e.g., from dropdown menus or <select> elements), you should try directly typing the input or selecting the choice, bypassing the need for an initial click.\n5. You should not attempt to create accounts, log in or do the final submission.\n6. Terminate when you deem the task complete or if it requires potentially harmful actions.\n7. Do not generate same action as the previous one, try different ways if keep failing, you can see your previous actions listed after 'previous_actions:'\n8. When there is a floating banner like ads, login, or survey floating taking more than 30% of the page, close the floating banner to proceed, the close button could look like a x on the right top corner, or choose NO THANKS to close it.\n9. When there is a floating banner on top or bottom of the page like cookie policy taking less than 30% of the page, ignore the banner to proceed.\n10. After typing text into search or text input area, the next action is normally PRESS ENTER\n11. When there are bouding boxes in the screenshot, interact with the elements in the bounding boxes\n12. When there are multiple clickable buttons having the same value, choose the one with less obstacles in the screenshot.\n",
